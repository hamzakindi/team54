# Technology Demostrator
This sample project demostrate how you can use ML with Prolog and expose them via fast api. The project also has a Next JS front end application that consume these API.
In this sample app I am using ML model for predicting diabetis and prolog for providing recommendation.

# Python environment
Use seperate python virtual environments for prolog and model fast api code.
I used medhack for model and medhack_prolog for prolog code.
